# Word-Distance-Measurer

The purpose of this program is to determine which words are created by adding a letter, subtracting a letter, or changing one particular letter in a given existing english word. For example, 'animal' might be changed to 'aimal', 'animals', or 'animas'.

Further goals are to determine which words are the most step changes away from the next closest words.
